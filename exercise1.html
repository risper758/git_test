    <p class="intro">Switching methods like <strong>circuit switching</strong>circuit switching is a method of data 
        <em>communication</em> that that sets up a physical communication path from 
        the sender to the receiver before any communication starts.All 
        the data is then <span class="accent-color"transferred using this single path </span></p>

            <img src="C:\Users\rispe\Desktop\pics\egg.jpg"alt="fried eggs">

    <P >While the circuit is open, no other device can transmit 
        data using that path. when the transmission is complete,the path
        is released for another transmission.</P>
